        <p class="intro-wide">Personr is an identity verification web application for companies to carry out background checks on their employees. Staff managers are able to send requests via email or text for employees to upload identity documents, their proof of residence, or even perform a liveness check via their mobile device.
          <br><br>
          Commissioned by a startup company, this project involved the creation of a number of key high-fidelity screens based off the client’s initial wireframes. The screens produced included: staff dashboard, an applicants index, the verification flow, admin settings, and the liveness check flow for mobile. These final designs would then be used to form a foundation that influences all other screens built at the development stage.
          <br><br>
          This method of working was due to a limit in the budget, however I believe it is a testament to the strength of the design work and branding that they could be used successfully to establish the full application and landing page.

      <p class="project-text">The process of creating a design can be brief (a quick sketch) or lengthy and complicated, involving considerable research, negotiation, reflection, modelling, interactive adjustment and re-design. In some cases, the direct construction of an object without an explicit prior plan (such as in craftwork and some engineering, coding, and graphic design) is also considered to be a design activity.</p>

      <p class="project-text">Design is: a specification of an object, manifested by an agent, intended to accomplish goals, in a particular environment, using a set of primitive components, satisfying a set of requirements, subject to constraints; (verb, transitive) to create a design, in an environment (where the designer operates)</p>
